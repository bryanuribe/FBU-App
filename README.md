Users can also start their own private or public game. By starting a private event, only users within your organization will be able to see your event. By starting a public event, it will appear for all users. 

Each event will feature details of the location/time and any notes that should be considered.

**Category:** Allows users to connect and find other local users that want to participate in a pick up game. The home screen will have all upcoming events nearby.  Users can also start their own private or public game. By starting a private event, only users within your organization will be able to see your event. By starting a public event, it will appear for all users. Each event will feature details of the location/time and any notes that should be considered.

**Story:** In downtime, this app will be useful to finding other users who want to play a pick up game locally. Especially useful if your friends are busy at the moment.

**Market:** Any soccer or basketball player.

**Habit:** Before going out to play a game with friends or by yourself, this app will be useful to find other local users who want to participate in a larger game.

**Scope:** V1 will allow you to view and create public / private events. Public events are visible to all people who are using the app. Private events are limited to user created organizations. Each event specifies the location, time, and other important notes to consider. To view these events the user will create a unique profile. You are able to edit your profile to display basic information such as a profile picture, username, bio, and the current team you are playing for. The user is also able to create organizations, where they can add their friends, and other people they meet casually so they can view their events.

V2 will allow you to further customize your event, and it will allow users to RSVP for an event. It will also display the list of users able to attend the event publicly. 

V3 will allow you to chat with users within your organization.
